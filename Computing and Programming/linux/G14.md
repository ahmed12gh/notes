# grub2 change theme **(fedora specific only)**


This works on the current Fedora 37/38 release
**This guide is for UEFI/EFI installs, so only follow this if you have grub2**
You can look for themes at [gnome-look](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse?cat=109) and [kde store](https://store.kde.org/browse?cat=109), here choose a theme. I chose [poly-light](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1176413).
	Download and Extract the theme. (make sure to look inside the folder if there are any other versions of the theme.

Open the Terminal and copy the file to **/boot/grub2/theme**, for example
`sudo cp -r poly-light /boot/grub2/theme`

Next after copying, you go into the grub config like so
`sudo nano /etc/default/grub`

Comment out the line **GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT=console**, by putting a # infront of it, and make a new like with the following:
**GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub2/theme/_INSERT-THEME_/theme.txt"**

Change INSERT-THEME to whatever the name of the folder is, that you copied earlier. Then you can press CTRL+S and CTRL+X to exit the config.
Finally you type:
`sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2-efi.cfg`
When you've done this, you can reboot and see if the theme applied
