## Ref vs & 
- `&` denotes that your pattern expects a reference to an object. Hence `&` is a part of said pattern: `&Foo` matches different objects than `Foo` does.
- `ref` indicates that you want a reference to an unpacked value. It is not matched against: `Foo(ref foo)` matches the same objects as `Foo(foo)`.
