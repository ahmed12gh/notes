Hippocrates  referred the, repetition of certain human qualities such as ==Crossed eye== and ==baldness== in a certain group of families. He also noted the spread of certain diseases such as ==epilepsy== and certain types of blindness in certain families. Greeks discovered the symptoms of some human syndromes such as (**Down's syndrome**).

# DNA 
- **DNA** has ability to be transported from one organism to another by some **viruses** and **plasmids** . [^1]
- it has ability to replicate inside a cell naturally and also outside, through the use of ==Polymerase Chain Reaction== (PCR).
- It has ability to **modulate** the recipient cell functions.

[^1]:  A **plasmid** is a small DNA molecule that is physically separate form, and can replicate independently of, chromosomal DNA within a cell.

# Mendel  Genetics  
 *Mendel* began to hold experiments on ==Pisum sativum== .
Some properties of living things used in genetics experiments It has become known that studies in genetics depend on the ==design of experiments and analysis of results==. This was for the purpose of extracting certain hypothesis about how to move different qualities. Here are some considerations that need to be taken into account when using a particular object for
**The Purpose of conducting genetic studies**

1. Short life cycle.
2. Large number of production.
3. Having the possibility to get variations and genetic mutations when organisms are exposed to unsuitable environmental conditions such as radiation and chemicals
4. Ability to control fertilization or mating of the object.
5. Easy upbringing and maintenance.
. Ability to produce new structures as a result of sexual reproduction or delivery (Transduction) by viruses.

## Allele
Alternative form of a gene. One of the different forms of a gene that can exist at a single ==locus.==. each chromatid of chromosome have one allele of a specific trait that is each chromosome have 2 alleles 1 from each parent. In mendalian Genetices ==TT==,==Tt==,==tt==  all represent two alleles.
## Genes
Is a ==sequence== of DNA that has a specific function, e.g:
- turning the genetic code to a protein 
- controlling the expression of character

can prove itself through ==contrast== ==alleles==.

## Gene Expression
It is the process of using DNA information by cells in the ==manufacturing== of a particular protein.

## Genotype
It reflects the composition or structure of the genetic of individual. It expresses the genetic codes together in a particular individual. it refers to the complete set of genes without relating to physical properties, as same phenotypes can result from different genotypes.E.g. **AB** and **Bo** or even **oo** are all genetypes 

## Phenotype or phenotypic category:
It refers to the properties or **observed signs of the organism** which is genetically controlled. 
e.g., stem length and stem shortness in **Pisum Sativum** 

plant referred to as expressions of natural information. These are available in the genetic factors. By following the principles of ==dominant== and ==recessive== traits we can tell about **phenotype** for the individual from the genotype. 

e.g. ==TT== and ==Tt== refer to the long stem and ==tt== refers to the short leg. 

When the individual carries genetic factors such as symmetric ==TT== or ==tt== it is said that the individuals are **homogeneous** or **pure (Homozygous)**. 

When the individual carries a genetic model which are not symmetric factors such as ==Tt==, it is said that the individual is **heterogeneous** or **hybrid** **(Heterozygous)** . 

### Types of relations between dominant traits 
- co-dominant 
- blend
