# DNA 

- **DNA** has ability to be transported from one organism to another by some **viruses** and **plasmids** . [^1]

[^1]:  A **plasmid** is a small DNA molecule that is physically separate form, and can replicate independently of, chromosomal DNA within a cell.

- it has ability to replicate inside a cell naturally and also outside, through the use of ==Polymerase Chain Reaction== (PCR).
- It has ability to modulate the recipient cell functions.

# Mendel  Genetics  
 *Mendel* began to hold experiments on ==Pisum sativum== .
Some properties of living things used in genetics experiments It has become known that studies in genetics depend on the ==design of experiments and analysis of results==. This was for the purpose of extracting certain hypothesis about how to move different qualities. Here are some considerations that need to be taken into account when using a particular object for
**The Purpose of conducting genetic studies**

1. Short life cycle.
2. Large number of production.
3. Having the possibility to get variations and genetic mutations when organisms are exposed to unsuitable environmental conditions such as radiation and chemicals
4. Ability to control fertilization or mating of the object.
5. Easy upbringing and maintenance.
. Ability to produce new structures as a result of sexual reproduction or delivery (Transduction) by viruses.
