*==Cytoplasm of a bacterial cell contains **ribosomes**.==* : 
The ribosome  ,help in protein synthesis ,they reads the messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence and translates that genetic code into a specified string of amino acids, which grow into long chains that fold to form proteins.

*==Q. What are the smallest and the largest cell==*? :  smallest **Mycoplasma gallicepticum** 0.2–0.3 μm, largest : egg cell of ostrich النعامة  

*==Glycolipids : they are **only** found on the **extracellular** side of the lipid bilayer==* : 
carbohydrates  found to be **attached** to the lipids or proteins on the **extracellular** side of the membrane, leading to the formation of **glycolipids** and **glycoproteins**

*==why the protein % is higher than lipids % in cell membrane  although its mostly seen to be consisting of lipids==* 
This higher proportion of proteins is primarily due to their diverse roles in cell membrane function
Since proteins are much larger than lipids, this percentage corresponds to about one protein molecule per every 50 to 100 molecules of lipid 

*==example of each synoival joints==* 
1. Planer : Planar joints are found in the carpal bones in the hand and the tarsal bones of the foot, as well as between vertebrae
2. Hinge : elbow
3. Pivot  : first and second vertebrae of the neck
4. Condyloid[^2] : in the joints of the wrist and fingers
5. Saddle : thumb joint
6. Ball-and-socket joints  : shoulder and hip joints
