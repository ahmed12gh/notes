histologically means to describe the types of cells , fiber and microscopic details  present in the tissue and 
# Definition
- connective tissue consists of *cells* and an *extracellular matrix* (ECM) ,
- Can usually divide 
- Cells have spaces between them filled with ECM
- have good blood supply  except for cartilage which is avascular and supplied by diffusion 
- Can be flexible or rigid in nature

# Types of Connective Tissue (C.T) 
Classification of connective tissue is based on the **composition** and ==organization of its cellular and extracellular components== and on its *functions*
1. Embryonic C.T
2. C.T Proper
3. Specialized C.T(cartilage, bone, & blood)

The functions of the various connective tissues are reflected in the types of cells and fibers present within the tissue and the composition of the ground substance in the ECM


# Connective Tissue Proper 
1. *Loose* connective tissue, sometimes called *areolar* tissue
2. *dense* connective tissue 
	1. dense *irregular*  
	2. dense *regular* 

# Connective tissue fibers
- Connective tissue fibers are present in **varying amounts**, depending on
	-  the **structural** needs 
	- or **function** of the connective tissue
- Each type of fiber is produced by *fibroblasts* 
- composed of *protein* consisting of *long peptide chains*
1. ==Collagen fibers== : are the thickest and most abundant type of fibers 
2. ==Reticular fibers== : 
	- Reticular fibers provide a **supporting framework** for the **cellular constituents** of various tissues and organs. **==reticular fiber keeps growing with aging==** 
	- Reticular fibers and *collagen type I fibers* share a prominent feature
1. ==Elastic fibers== : 
	 - Elastic fibers allow tissues to respond to **stretch and distension**.  
	 - Elastic fibers are typically **thinner** than collagen fibers  
	 - are arranged in a branching pattern to form a **three dimensional network**.
	 - The fibers are *interwoven with collagen fibers* to **limit the distensibility** of the tissue and prevent tearing from excessive stretching

# Extracellular Matrix (ECM) 
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex and intricate structural network that **surrounds and supports cells within the connective tissue**
- Contains a variety of **fibers** such as collagen and elastic fibers that are **formed from different types of structurally  proteins.**
- ==The ECM contains a variety of== 
	- *proteoglycans* [^1] e.g
		- aggrecan 
		- syndecan
	- *multi adhesive glycoproteins* [^2]such as
		- fibronectin 
		- laminin
	- and *glycos-amino-glycans*[^3] e.g.
		- dermatan sulfate
		- keratan sulfate
		- hyaluronan
	- The last three groups of molecules constitute the ***ground substance***
- ==Ground substance== is the part of the extracellular matrix that occupies the spaces between the cells and fibers; 
	- Ground substance is a **viscous**, **clear** substance with a slippery feel and **high water content** that help to absorb shock.
- ==Functions  of ECM==
	- provides mechanical and structural **support** as well as tensile **strength** for the tissue
	- as a *biochemical barrier* 
	- plays a role in **regulating** metabolic functions of the cells surrounded by the matrix.ECM allow cell to cell communication 
	- The ECM **anchors** cells within tissues through *cell-to-ECM adhesion molecules*  
	- provides *pathways for cell migration* (e.g., during wound repair)

[^1]:**a class of glycoproteins of high molecular weight that are found especially in the extracellular matrix of connective tissue**
[^2]:**cell recognition, adhesion, migration and proliferation**.
[^3]:mucopolysaccharides, are **negatively-charged polysaccharide compounds**repeating disaccharide units that are present in every mammalian tissue

# Connective tissue cells 
Connective tissue cells can be **resident** or **wandering**
1. The cells that make up the *resident* cell population are **relatively stable**; they typically exhibit little movement and can be regarded as *permanent residents of the tissue*.
	1. **fibroblasts** and a closely related cell type, the **myofibroblast** : Fibroblasts make [collagen fibres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen "Collagen"), [glycosaminoglycans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosaminoglycan "Glycosaminoglycan"), [reticular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_fiber "Reticular fiber") and [elastic fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_fibers),fibroblasts play a critical role in an immune response to a tissue injury
	2. **macrophages** : phagocytosis of ECM debris  , antigen processing , secret growth hormones  and cytokines , Macrophages wander when needed 
	3. **adipocytes** : fat storage ,
	4. **mast cells :** Pharmacology  active , E.g ( secret histamine) 
	5. **adult stem cells** : committed adult stem cell produce specific kind of tissue only 
2. The *wandering* cell population or transient cell population consists primarily of cells that have *migrated into the tissue from the blood in response to specific stimuli.*
	-  **lymphocytes** : defence function 
	- **plasma cells** : anti body
	-  **neutrophils** : phagocytosis of bacteria 
	-  **eosinophils** : modulate allergic / vasoactive reactions and defend against parasites 
	- **basophils** : pharmacologically active  
	- **monocytes**
