The pectoral girdle, also known as the shoulder girdle, forms the **attachment point** of the upper limbs **to the axial skeleton**.
It consists of two paired bones: the *clavicle* and the *scapula*.The pectoral girdle provides ==stability and support== for the shoulder joint, enabling a wide range of motion in the upper limbs.

# The Clavicle (Collarbone)
is a **slenderنحيل**, **S-shaped long** bone approximately **6 inches (15 cm)** long that serves as a strutدعامة between the *shoulder blade* and the *sternum* (breastbone). There are two clavicles, one on the left and one on the right. The clavicle is the ==only long bone in the body that lies horizontally== 

1. Medial end : sternal end
2. Lateral end : acromial end (articulates with the shoulder)
3. Shaft : 

*==Clinical Anatomy==*: The clavicle is the most **commonly fractured bone** in the Upper limb. It can easily be fractured **by impacts to the shoulder** from the force of falling on outstretched arms or by a direct hit

***Lateral region*** of the shaft The lateral region of the shaft has 
- two borders  
	-  **anterior border** is concave forward and gives origin to the deltoid muscle.
	-  **posterior border** is convex and gives attachment to the trapezius muscle.Cartilage  
- the **inferior** surface has a ridge called the *trapezoid line* and a **tubercle**(small rounded projection); the *conoid tubercle* for attachment with the trapezoid and the conoid ligament, part of the *coracoclavicular ligament* that serves to connect the *collarbone* with the *coracoid process of the scapula*

# The Scapula (Shoulder Blade) 
It is a **triangular**, **flat** bone, which serves as a site for **attachment for many (17) muscles**.

*==Surface Anatomy==*:
- *Acromion* prominence بروز vertebral level T2
- *Scapular Spine* its root has vertebral level of T3
- Inferior angle of the Scapula vertebral level T7
