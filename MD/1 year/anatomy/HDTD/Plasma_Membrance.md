The cell membrane, also known as the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic membrane,  
# Functions 
- **Selective Permeability**: The cell membrane **controls** the movement of **ions**, **molecules**, and other substances **in and out** of the cell
- **Protection**: It provides protection to the cell's interior by **keeping** harmful or unwanted substances from **freely entering**
- **Cell Recognition**: The cell membrane contains **proteins** and **glycoproteins** that play a role in **cell recognition** and **cell-to-cell communication** 
- **Transport**: Various **transport proteins** are embedded in the cell membrane.
	- These proteins **facilitate** the transport of specific ions and molecules across the membrane, ensuring that essential nutrients and ions enter the cell while waste products are removed
 - **Maintaining Cell Shape**: The cell membrane helps maintain the shape of the cell by providing **structural support** 
 - **Cell Adhesion**: It is involved in cell adhesion, allowing cells to stick together in tissues and organs

# Structures 
- ==lipids== = 42%  , The supporting structure
- ==proteins== = 55% , There are two main categories of membrane proteins, **integral** and **peripheral**
- ==carbohydrates==  = 3% ,found to be **attached** to the lipids or proteins on the **extracellular** side of the membrane, leading to the formation of **glycolipids** and **glycoproteins**

## Lipids 
- Phospholipids  (25 %)
- Cholesterol (13 %)
- Glycolipids ; Other lipid along side Glycolipids make 4%

**Cholesterol** : Another lipid composed of **four fused carbon rings**, is found alongside phospholipids in the **core** of the membrane. 

**Glycolipids**: These are **sugar-containing lipid** molecules, and they are **only** found on the **extracellular** side of the lipid bilayer .
### Phospholipids :
are molecules that form the cell membrane. 
- They consist of a **polar *phosphate* head** group and **two nonpolar *fatty acid* tails** joined by a ***glycerol* backbone**. 
- The phosphate group can link with different molecules. 
- Phospholipids arranged in a **bilayer**, they are **amphipathic**, meaning that they have both **hydrophilic** and **hydrophobic** regions

**hydrophilic** (water loving)  :  A portion of a phospholipid is its **head**, which contains a **negatively charged phosphate group $PO_4^{-}$**, attracted to water on the **inner/outer** parts of the cell

**hydrophobic** (water fearing) :  part of a phospholipid that consists of its **long, nonpolar fatty acid** tails. The fatty acid tails can **easily** interact with other **nonpolar** molecules, but they interact **poorly** with **water**

## Proteins 
***Integral membrane proteins***: are integrated into the membrane, they have at least one **hydrophobic** region that **anchors them to the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer**. Some stick only partway into the membrane, while others stretch from one side of the membrane to the other and are exposed on either side. Proteins that extend all the way across the membrane are called **transmembrane** proteins. Integral proteins function as : 
- structural *channels* (or **pores**) 
- ==**carrier proteins**== 
- *enzymes* (catalyze chemical reactions).
- *receptors* for water-soluble chemicals

***Peripheral membrane proteins***: proteins are found on the **outside and inside surfaces** of membranes, **attached** either to *integral proteins or to phospholipids*. Unlike integral membrane proteins, peripheral membrane proteins **do not stick** to the hydrophobic core(tails) of the membrane, and they tend to be **more loosely attached** ,function almost entirely as:
- enzymes
-  *controllers* of transport of substances through the cell membrane **pores**.

## Carbohydrates  **Glycocalyx**
- Membrane carbohydrates occur in combination with proteins or lipids in the form of *glycoproteins* or *glycolipids*
	- Have a **negative** electrical charge,
	- The glycocalyx of some cells **attaches** to the glycocalyx of other cells.
	- Act as *receptor* substances for **binding hormones** 
	- Some carbohydrate types *enter into immune reactions*

# Cell Membrane Disease: 
cause different diseases when improperly functioning, these diseases are
1. Genetic diseases.
2. Infectious diseases.
3. Diseases with Unknown Causes.

## Genetic Diseases 
***==Cystic fibrosisتليّف كيسي==*** is a **recessive** genetic disease. *This means that both parents contribute one affected gene to the child*. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a **mutation** in the **cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator** (CFTR) *protein* which helps ==move water and salt== across the cell membrane , When the CFTR is not functional, secretions that are usually thin instead become thick 

## Infectious  Diseases 
 caused by infections from **bacteria** or **viruses**. One example is ***==cholera==***, a disease caused by the ==**bacterium Vibrio cholerae**==. Cholera is essentially the opposite of cystic fibrosis. In fact, in both conditions, the same protein, CFTR, is affected. During cholera infection, the CFTR protein is **attacked** so that the cell **secretes too much water**. This results in severe **diarrhea**, and **dehydration** is a major concern

## Diseases with Unknown Causes: 
***==Alzheimer's disease==*** is a very serious condition that involves the **build-up of plaques[^1]** in the **brain**. While we don't completely understand what causes the initial formation of these plaques, some evidence suggests that dysfunctional membrane proteins may play a role. This is further supported by **evidence showing that unhealthy cholesterol levels** are often found in Alzheimer's patients. Cholesterol is an important part of the cell membrane.

# Physiology 
Most organelles of the cell are covered by membranes (not the Cell Membrane  ) composed primarily of lipids and proteins. 
# Transport through the cell membrane 
- Either directly through the *lipid bilayer* or through the *proteins*, occurs by one of two basic processes 
	1. ***Diffusion*** : means random molecular movement of substances molecule by molecule 
		- either through **intermolecular spaces** in the membrane 
		- or in combination with a **carrier protein(integral proteins)**, 
		- the energy that causes diffusion is the energy of the *normal kinetic motion of matter*
	2. ***Active transport*** : means movement of ions or other substances across the membrane in combination with a carrier protein 
		- in such a way that the carrier protein causes the substance to **move against** an *energy gradient*, 
		- such as from a low-concentration state to a high- concentration state, 
		- It ==requires an additional source of energy besides kinetic energy==

## Diffusion  
*Diffusion through the Cell Membrane*: 
1. ***Simple diffusion*** : Simple diffusion means that kinetic movement of molecules or ions occurs through a membrane opening or through intermolecular spaces *without any interaction with carrier proteins in the membrane.*
	- **Diffusion of Lipid-*Soluble* Substances through the Lipid Bilayer** :  
		- **lipid solubility of the substance**.determine how rapidly a substance diffuses through the lipid bilayer   
		- Eg. the lipid solubilities of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and alcohols are **high**, so that all these can *dissolve directly in the lipid bilayer* and *diffuse* through the cell membrane
	- **Diffusion of Water and Other Lipid-*Insoluble* Molecules through Protein Channels** 
		- *Water* readily passes through channels in protein molecules .
		- *Other lipid-insoluble* molecules can pass through the protein pore channels in the same way as water molecules **if they are water soluble and small enough**
	- **Gating** of These Channels : protein channels are distinguished by  characteristic 
		-  often *selectively permeable* to certain substances 
		-  channels can be **opened or closed** by *gates*
	- **Osmosis** Across Selectively Permeable Membranes (**Net Diffusion of Water**)
		- net movement of water caused by a concentration difference of water
1.  ***Facilitated diffusion*** :  called **carrier-mediated diffusion**
	- requires interaction of a carrier protein. The carrier protein aids passage of the molecules or ions through the membrane by *binding chemically with them* and **shuttlingسافر ذهابا وايابا** them through the membrane 
### Factors That Affect the Net Rate of Diffusion 
What is usually important is the *net rate of diffusion of a substance in the desired direction*. This net rate is determined by several factors 
1. ***Concentration Difference*** : 
	- The rate at which the substance *diffuses inward is proportional to the concentration of molecules on the outside*, because this concentration determines how **many molecules strike the outside of the membrane each second** 
	- $Net_{diffusion} μ  = C_{Out} - C_{In}$
2. ***Membrane Electrical Potential*** (**Nenrst** potential) : 
	- If an electrical potential is applied across the membrane, the *electrical charges of the ions cause them to move* through the membrane even though **no concentration difference** exists to cause movement. 
	- At normal body temperature (37°C), the *electrical difference that will balance a given concentration difference of **uni-valent** ions* 
	- such as sodium $Na^+$ ions concentration  can be determined from the following formula, called the Nernst equation $$EMF_{mili-volt} = \pm 61 \log \frac{C1}{C2}$$
3. ***Pressure Difference***  
	- **Pressure** means the sum of all the forces of the different molecules striking a unit surface area at a given instant.
	- when the pressure is higher on one side of a membrane than on the other, this means that the sum of all the forces of the molecules striking the channels on that side of the membrane is greater than on the other side. The result is that increased amounts of energy are available to *cause net movement of molecules from the high- pressure side toward the low-pressure side*

## Active Transport 
1. ***primary active transport***  
	- energy is derived directly from breakdown of  (ATP) & Other phosphate compounds
	- Eg. **Sodium-Potassium Pump** : 
		- It has ==three== *receptor sites* for binding **sodium ions** on the portion of the *protein* that protrudes  to the *inside* of the cell
		- It has ==two== receptor sites for **potassium ions** on the *outside* 
		- The **inside** portion of this protein near the sodium binding sites has **ATPase activity**
		- Electrogenic Nature of the $Na^+ K^+$ Pump
			- It creates an *electrical potential* across the cell membrane. This electrical potential is a basic ==requirement in nerve and muscle fibers for transmitting nerve and muscle signals==
	- ![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231124173401.png]]
1. ***secondary active transport*** 
	-  energy is derived secondarily from energy that has been *stored in the form of ionic concentration differences* of secondary molecular or ionic substances between the two sides of a cell membrane, created originally by primary active transport
	- **Co-Transport** 
		- ions are transported out of cells by primary active transport, a large concentration gradient of sodium ions across the cell membrane usually develops [^1]
		- This gradient represents a **storehouse of energy** because the ==excess sodium outside the cell membrane is always attempting to diffuse to the interior==. 
		-  *diffusion energy of sodium can pull other substances* along with the sodium through the cell membrane. This phenomenon is called **co-transport**
	- **Counter-Transport** 
		- **sodium** ion binds to the carrier protein
			- where it **projects to the exterior surface** of the membrane, 
			- while the substance to be counter- transported binds to the **interior projection** of the carrier protein.
		- Once both have bound, a conformational مطابق change occurs, and **energy released** by the *sodium ion moving to the interior causes the other substance to move to the exterior*.
		- ![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231124183428.png]]
	- **Co-Transport of Glucose and Amino Acids Along with Sodium Ions** 
		- *Sodium co-transport of glucose and amino acids* occurs especially through the ==epithelial cells of the intestinal tract and the renal tubules of the kidneys== to **promote absorption of these substances into the blood**
	- ![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231124173604.png]]

*The carrier protein in active transport is capable of impartingنقل energy to the transported substance to move it against the electrochemical gradient*
