The cell membrane, also known as the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic membrane,  
# Functions 
- **Selective Permeability**: The cell membrane **controls** the movement of **ions**, **molecules**, and other substances **in and out** of the cell
- **Protection**: It provides protection to the cell's interior by **keeping** harmful or unwanted substances from **freely entering**
- **Cell Recognition**: The cell membrane contains **proteins** and **glycoproteins** that play a role in **cell recognition** and **cell-to-cell communication** 
- **Transport**: Various **transport proteins** are embedded in the cell membrane.
	- These proteins **facilitate** the transport of specific ions and molecules across the membrane, ensuring that essential nutrients and ions enter the cell while waste products are removed
 - **Maintaining Cell Shape**: The cell membrane helps maintain theshape of the cell by providing **structural support** 
 - **Cell Adhesion**: It is involved in cell adhesion, allowing cells to stick together in tissues and organs

# Structures 
- ==lipids== = 42%  , The supporting structure
- ==proteins== = 54% , There are two main categories of membrane proteins, **integral** and **peripheral**
- ==carbohydrates==  = 3% ,found to be **attached** to the lipids or proteins on the **extracellular** side of the membrane, leading to the formation of **glycolipids** and **glycoproteins**

## Lipids 
- Phospholipids 
- Cholesterol
- Glycolipids

**Cholesterol**: Another lipid composed of **four fused carbon rings**, is found alongside phospholipids in the **core** of the membrane. 

**Glycolipids**: These are **sugar-containing lipid** molecules, and they are **only** found on the **extracellular** side of the lipid bilayer

### Phospholipids:
are molecules that form the cell membrane. 
- They consist of a **polar phosphate head** group and **two nonpolar fatty acid tails** joined by a **glycerol backbone**. 
- The phosphate group can link with different molecules. 
- Phospholipids arranged in a **bilayer**, they are **amphipathic**, meaning that they have both **hydrophilic** and **hydrophobic** regions

**hydrophilic** (water loving)  :  A portion of a phospholipid is its **head**, which contains a **negatively charged phosphate group $PO_4^{-}$**, attracted to water on the **inner/outer** parts of the cell

**hydrophobic** (water fearing) :  part of a phospholipid that consists of its **long, nonpolar fatty acid** tails. The fatty acid tails can **easily** interact with other **nonpolar** molecules, but they interact **poorly** with **water**

## Proteins 
**Integral membrane proteins**: are integrated into the membrane, they have at least one **hydrophobic** region that **anchors them to the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer**. Some stick only partway into the membrane, while others stretch from one side of the membrane to the other and are exposed on either side. Proteins that extend all the way across the membrane are called **transmembrane** proteins.

**Peripheral membrane proteins**: proteins are found on the **outside and inside surfaces** of membranes, **attached** either to *integral proteins or to phospholipids*. Unlike integral membrane proteins, peripheral membrane proteins **do not stick** to the hydrophobic core(tails) of the membrane, and they tend to be **more loosely attached**

# Cell Membrane Disease: 
cause different diseases when improperly functioning, these diseases are
1. Genetic diseases.
2. Infectious diseases.
3. Diseases with Unknown Causes.

## Genetic Diseases 
***==Cystic fibrosisتليّف كيسي==*** is a **recessive** genetic disease. *This means that both parents contribute one affected gene to the child*. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a **mutation** in the **cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator** (CFTR) *protein* which helps ==move water and salt== across the cell membrane , When the CFTR is not functional, secretions that are usually thin instead become thick 

## Infectious  Diseases 
 caused by infections from **bacteria** or **viruses**. One example is ***==cholera==***, a disease caused by the ==**bacterium Vibrio cholerae**==. Cholera is essentially the opposite of cystic fibrosis. In fact, in both conditions, the same protein, CFTR, is affected. During cholera infection, the CFTR protein is **attacked** so that the cell **secretes too much water**. This results in severe **diarrhea**, and **dehydration** is a major concern

## Diseases with Unknown Causes: 
***==Alzheimer's disease==*** is a very serious condition that involves the **build-up of plaques[^1]** in the **brain**. While we don't completely understand what causes the initial formation of these plaques, some evidence suggests that dysfunctional membrane proteins may play a role. This is further supported by **evidence showing that unhealthy cholesterol levels** are often found in Alzheimer's patients. Cholesterol is an important part of the cell membrane.
