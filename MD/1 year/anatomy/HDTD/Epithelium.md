# Cell Junctions  
These junctions are important to *avoid separation* of cells by mechanical forces 

1. **Occluding** - **Tight** junctions : *seal* adjacent cell membranes with each other for movement of materials between cells 
	- Zonula occludens (regional circumference )
2. **Adhesive** - **Anchoring** junctions: *tie* adjacent cell membranes with each other
	- Zonula adherens - adhesive belt
	- Desmosomes (**macula** adherens) - adhesive **spot**
	- Hemi-desmosomes (half)
3. Gap junctions/ communicating junctions.

## Zonula Occludens  (tight junctions )
Present  **near the apical surface** of cells. It seals intercellular space along the entire circumference of cell. It is composed of **transmembrane proteins**, such as ***occludin***. These proteins provide attachment to intercellular actin filaments through ***zonula occludens*** proteins , tight junctions join together the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells.

**Located** in the epithelium of **intestine**, **renal** tubules, and **urinary** bladder
**Functions**:
- Provides **firm** cellular adhesion
- **seals** intercellular space
- Provide barrier to **prevent** entry of contents of organ into blood as in urinary bladder

## Adhesive / Anchoring junctions
### Zonula adherens / Adhesive belt 
It lies **bellow tight junctions** and provides **lateral adhesion** between adjacent cells. It **completely** encircles the cell. There is a *gap* of about **15-20 nm** between adjacent cell membranes, with membrane **thickening** due to deposited *proteins* on *inner* cytoplasmic side. These proteins provide **attachment** to cytoplasmic **actin filaments** Transmembrane proteins ***cadherin*** attach with actin filament.

The apical part of cell has a **network of actin filaments** that runs horizontally forming zonula adherens. These fibers form a **terminal web** (**TW**). *Contraction* of actin filaments of terminal web will **spread out microvilli** and increase the area for absorption

## Gap (communicating) junctions
Intercellular channels that provide **communication** between adjacent cells through **small canaliculi**. The **distance** between cell membranes is very **small**; <nm.

Gap junction is formed by a protein called **connexons**. Six connexons molecules run across cell membranes of adjacent cells creating small **canaliculus** with pores on both cells
**Location**:
Smooth and cardiac muscle cells.
**Functions**:
- Help to pass substances across cells.
- Help to **excite and contract *entire* muscle together**
## Medical Applicaitons 
### Pemphigus vulgaris:
Is a blistering disease involving the **epidermis of oral mucosa**, due to **abnormal desmosome function** caused by **autoimmune reaction against cadherin proteins**, and this will cause intercellular separation.

### Bullous pemphigoid: 
an **autoimmune** disease due to **absence** of one of the connecting **proteins in hemidesmosomes**. The patient suffers large fluid-filled blisters.



# Specialization and modification of cell surface 
According to the **functional need**, the apical surface (luminal surface) 
- Microvilli
- Stereocilia
- Cilia
![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/Resources/Pasted image 20231121004041.png]]![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/Resources/Pasted image 20231121004059.png]]
## Microvilli 
- Finger- like **cytoplasmic extensions** of the apical epithelial surface of absorptive cells In 
	- small intestine,
	- gall bladder  , bile duct,  
	- **proximal** convoluted tubule of the **kidney**.
- They increase the surface area for absorption or secretion. 
- Each microvillus is about **1 μm** long and **0.1 μm** wide 

### Structure of microvillus:
1- Cytoplasmic core **of 20-30 actin filaments** that run from **tip** of microvillus to the **terminal web**.
2- Myosin molecules: run **between** *cell membrane and actin filaments, and at terminal web*. Both **actin** and **myosin** help in motilityالحركة of microvillus


## Stereocilia 
Are similar to microvilli but **longer and thicker**. They present in sensory cells of internal ear, and lining of epididymis, They are **non-motile**, and may show **branching**. 

**Functions**:
1- in **internal ear**: act as sensory **mechanoreceptors**.
2- in **epididymis**: *increase surface area* for absorption of fluids
## Cilia 
Hair- like apical projections, about **10 μm** long and **0.25 μm** diameter.

**Types of cilia**:
1- **Motile** cilia: present in **respiratory** epithelium and **Fallopian tube**.
2- **Non-motile** cilia: present in **photoreceptor cells of retina**, and **olfactory** neurons. They help in **chemical sensation**.

*Cilia move in a beating pattern, to move fluids and other materials over epithelial surface*

 **Structure** 
composed of core structure called **axoneme**. Axoneme is composed of
- **central** pair of *microtubules*, and 
- nine **peripheral** pairs of microtubules

Axoneme also contains **motor proteins** necessary for its function. They are:
1. **Kinesin**.
2. **Dynein**.
Axoneme is attached to(by) **basal bodies** at the **apical part** of cell, bellow the cell membrane.

 **Location**:
- Respiratory tract,
- sperms, 
- fallopian tube.

**Functions**:
- Ciliary movement removes mucous from epithelial surface.
- Helps in motility of sperms
- Helps in bringing ova and sperm at the site of fertilization in fallopian tube, and moves fertilized ovum towards uterus.

## Medical Applicaitons 
### Celiac disease, 
also called **gluten-sensitive enteropathy** or **sprue**, is a disorder of the small intestine in which one of the first pathologic changes is **loss of the microvilli** (brush border) of the absorptive cells. This is caused by an **immune** reaction against the **wheat protein gluten** during its digestion, which produces **diffuse enteritis** (intestinal inflammation), changes to the epithelial cells leading to **malabsorption**, and eventually to pathologic changes in the intestinal wall. 
*The malabsorption problems and structural changes are reversible when gluten is removed from the diet*

### Immotile cilia syndrome (Kartagener syndrome), primary ciliary dyskinesiaخلل الحركة:
It affects respiratory tract, sperms, and fallopian tube, whose symptoms are chronic respiratory infections caused by the lack of the cleansing action of cilia in the respiratory tract and immotile spermatozoa, causing male infertility. It is caused by **mutation that affect the dynein proteins of cilia**
