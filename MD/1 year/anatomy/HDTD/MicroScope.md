# Simple Microscope 
microscope that uses a **single lens** for the magnification of the sample

## Use
- By dermatologist to find out various skin diseases 
- In Microbiology to study algae and fungi 

# Compound microscope 
Compound microscope:  has more than one lens. It has a combination of **lenses** and two optical parts known as an **objective lens** and an **eyepiece** (**ocular lens**)

1. **Head (body):** It carries the optical parts in the upper part of the microscope.
2. **Base**: It carries microscopic light source.
3. **Arms**: This is the part connecting the base to the head and also used when carrying the microscope.
4. **Eyepiece** (**ocular**): This is the part used to look through the microscope. Its found at the top of the microscope.
5. **Objective lenses** : low (10x), high (40x) , oil immersion (100x).
6. **Nose piece** : It holds objective lenses.
7. **Coarse adjustment**: It is used for initial focusing.
8. **Fine adjustment**: It used to fine focus the image when viewing at the higher magnifications.
9. **Stage**: This is the section in which the specimen is placed it has clips.
10. **Aperture** : This is a hole in the microscope stage which the light transmitted.
11. **Light source**: located at the base.
## Use 
In biological field :
- Cell Biology.
- Histology.
- Microbiology.
- Pathology.
- Cytology[^1].
- Immunohistochemistry [^2]

[^1]:_Cytology_ is the exam of a single cell type, as often found in fluid specimens. It's mainly used to diagnose or screen for cancer 
[^2]:technique that exploits the specific binding between an antibody and antigen to detect and localize specific antigens in cells and tissue

# Electron microscope 
It is a special type of microscope with a **high resolution** of images as the images can be magnified in **nanometers**
## Types : 
- The **transmission** electron microscope (TEM).
	- ![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231128150127.png|400]]
- The **scanning** electron microscope (SEM).
	- ![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231128150109.png|400]]

## Uses 
In biomedical research . investigating *detailed structures* of **tissue** , **cells**, **organelles** , **macro-molecular complexes** 


# Stereomicroscope. 
![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231128150244.png|500]]

# Fluorescence microscope 
A fluorescence microscope works by **combining the magnifying properties of the light microscope with fluorescence emitting properties of compounds**.

# prokaryotic  cells 
Gram positive bacteria have a **thick peptidoglycan layer** and *no* outer lipid membrane , they are stained by **either purple or *==blue==* in color**
![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231128150953.png]]
whilst Gram negative bacteria have a **thin peptidoglycan layer** and have an **outer lipid membrane**they are stained by either *==pink or red==* in color

# blood cells  
- RBC in Human mature red blood cells don't have nuclei

- RBC In Frog  , Frogs have nuclei 
	- ![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231128151922.png]]
- white blood cells (W.B.Cs): 
	- Granulated: like neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils 
	- ![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231128152014.png]]
	- A granulated: like lymphocytes and monocytes.
