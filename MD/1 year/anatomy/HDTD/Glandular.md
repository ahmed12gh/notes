# Classifications 
- no. of cells 
	- unicellular 
	- multicellular 
- presence  of Ducts 
	- with ( **exocrine** )
	- without ( **endocrine**)
- manner of secretions
	- **Mero-crine** exocytosis 
	- **Apo-crine** part of cell
	- **Holo-crine** whole cell 

# Number of Cells 
## Unicellular 
Consists of **isolated** glandular cells as goblet cells. These cell lie among lining epithelium of **intestine** or **respiratory** epithelium.

**Goblet** cell has a **cup shape** with **narrow basal stem**. The apical cytoplasm has numerous **secretory vesicles** filled with **mucus**, and nucleus is **flat**, and pushed to the **basal** side of the cell 
In ordinary H&E stain[^1], apical portion of goblet cell appears **empty**, because *mucus is removed during preparation of tissue slide*. It is demonstrated better with **PAS** stain (**Periodic acid Schiff** special stain for mucin).

**Functions**: Secrete mucus

## Multicellular 
Composed of clusters of cells that **aggregate** to form a complex structure; the gland. such as **salivary glands** and **pancreas** 

# Exocrine Glands 
Composed of two parts:
1. **Secretory** portion: supported by a connective tissue **stroma**.
2. **Duct**: to transport the secretion out of the gland 
![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231121212310.png|**|400]]
## Exocrine glands are classified according to:
1. **No.** of **branches** of **ducts**:
	- Simple, 
	- Compound.
2. **Shape** of secretory unit: 
	- Tubular,
	- Alveolar,
	- Tubulo-alveolar .
3. **Nature** of secretory **product**:
	- Serous, 
	- Mucus, 
	- Mixed.
4. **Mechanism** of secretion: 
	- Merocrine, 
	- Apocrine, 
	- Holocrine

# according To No OF Branch 
## Simple glands *Exocrine* 
Have one **unbranched** duct. It could be either:
1. Simple **tubular**: 
	- intestinal gl.
1. simple **coiled** tubular: 
	- sweat gl.
1. Simple **branched tubular** gl.: 
	-  gastric gland, 
	- esophageal gl., 
	-  gl. Of duodenum

# Classification based on shape of secretory unit 
## Tubular glands 
The **secretory portion** **is tube- shaped**, which could be
- straight, : intestine 
- coiled, : sweat 
- branched  
	- simple :  gastric , eosphagal , duodenum 
	- compound : duodenum (brunner's)
## Acinar/ Alveolar gland 
The secretory portion is **spherical** (round in cross section). When acinar gland become active, the secretory portion becomes **flask**- shaped (**alveolar**). 
- simple : sebaceous 
- compound : pancreas 


# Classification based on nature of secretion 
**acinus** (pl. acini) glands are always **alveolar**. 
![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231123233136.png]]
## Serous glands 
- Secrete **protein-rich watery secretion**. 
- The *secretory portion* is **serous acinus**, which is lined by **pyramidal shaped columnar epithelium**.
- Serous cell has **rounded basal nucleus**,
- **large** amount of **rough** endoplasmic reticulum RER( gives the cell **basophilic** stain *Purple* ),
- well developed **Golgi** complex,
-  many **secretory vesicles** in the apical region of cell
- ![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231121221741.png|**|600x300]]
## Mucous glands 
- *Mucous acinus has wider lumen than serous acinus* 
- **Secrete thick, mucoid** secretion. 
- The secretory portion is **mucous acinus**, which is lined by *pyramidal columnar epithelium*. 
- Mucous cell has **flat basal nucleus**,
- cytoplasm is rich in **mucinogen granules**. 
- When stained with H&E stain, mucous cells appear empty because mucin is removed during preparation of slide. .
- ![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231121222429.png|*|600x300]]
## Mixed  Glands 
- Secrete both **mucus and enzyme- rich watery secretion**. 
- The secretory portion is **mucous acinus with serous demilunes هلال او قبعة**. 
	- Mucous acinus is capped with serous cells to form serous demilunes. 
	- Mixed acinus is lined by both mucous and serous cells

#  Classification based on mode of secretion
![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231121230702.png]]![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231121230713.png]]![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231121230727.png]]
## Merocrine/eccrine glands
In these glands the secretion is found within **vesicles**. The secretory material is secreted by **exocytosis**, *when the membrane of secretory vesicle **fuses** with apical surface of cell and get out*. 
It is the most common type of glands. Found in **pancreas**, and **merocrine sweat glands**.
## Apocrine glands (apo-apical)
The secretory product is synthesized in the **apical** portion of the cell, and **both** this part with the **secretion** are **shed off**.
E.g. :  **lactating mammary** gland, **apocrine sweat gland**, **ceruminous[^2] glands of external ear**

[^2]:**produce the cerumen, the ear wax**
## Holocrine glands
The secretion is discharged by **disintegration** of the cell (programmed cell death).
Example:
- sebaceous glands, 
- tarsal glands of the eye.`situated upon the inner surfaces of the eyelids, between the tarsi and conjunctiva`

# Paracrine secretion 
Cells secrete substances into the **extracellular matrix** that affect **near** by cells by **diffusion**,
*secretion do not enter blood stream*. E.g. : 
- Endothelial cells secrete **vaso-dilators** act on **smooth** muscles to relax **vascular** wall
# Autocrine secretion 
*Cells secrete substances affecting the same cell*. The secretion is either 
- **excitatory** or
- **inhibitory**.

Example: Activation of cells of immune system by **interleukins**[^3]

[^3]: **Interleukins** (ILs) are a group of [cytokines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine "Cytokine") (secreted [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteins "Proteins") and [signal molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_molecule "Signal molecule")) that are expressed and secreted by [white blood cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell)

# Medical Applicaiton  
## Acne vulgaris 
is an Excessive **holocrine** secretion of **sebum** and **keratin** triggered by the surge of the steroid hormone **testosterone** that occurs in both genders at **puberty** frequently leads to *blocked ducts within the gland*. Activity of the normal skin bacterium within the blocked duct commonly produces localized inflammation.
## Benign and malignant tumors
Benign and malignant tumors **arise from most types of epithelial tissues**. 
## Malignant tumor 
 malignant tumor is called **carcinoma**, and if *arise from gland* called **adenocarcinoma** adeno(gland)
## Neoplasia 
 Neoplasia: is an abnormal growth and **dysplasia**(change of tissue type) of epithelial cells.
