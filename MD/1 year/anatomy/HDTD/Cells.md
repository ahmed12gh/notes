# What is a Cell 
cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms. It is the smallest independently functioning unit within the body that can perform the necessary processes of life
# Classifications of Cells in Organisms 
## Based on the Number of cells 
- **unicellular**  : Organisms composed of a single cell that carries out all necessary functions. Examples include bacteria
- **multicellular** : Organisms composed of multiple cells organized into specialized tissues and organs

## Based on the Type of Cells 
- **Prokaryotic** Cells : Simple, structurally less complex cells lacking a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria and Amoeba are examples of prokaryotic organisms
- **Eukaryotic Cells**: More complex cells with a defined nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Plants, animals, fungi, are eukaryotes
## Size and shape of cells
Cell come in various sizes and shapes, **depending on their specific functions**
- **The cells size** : is variable, range between 1-100 **micrometer** or may be large as a few centimeters.
- **The cells shape**:
	- are **round**, **elongated** or **spherical**.
	-  cells which are long and pointed on both the ends. Such cells exhibit **spindle**  shape.
	-  the cells are very long some may be branched like the neuron 
# Prokaryotic , E.g : Bacterial Cell
Bacteria are unicellular organisms belonging to the prokaryotic group where the organisms do not contain membrane organelles, so they have **no** *nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum*, or *Golgi apparatus*. Cytoplasm of a bacterial cell contains **ribosomes**. *==Why==*? 

The **cell wall** forms a **hard structure** of **uniform thickness** around the cell and is responsible for the characteristic **shape** of the cell (**rod, coccus, or spiral**)

 **additional specialized structure** like : 
- **Capsule**: Is a **sticky** layer of **carbohydrates** that surrounds the cell.
- **Flagella**: Some bacteria have flagella that allow the bacteria to **move in liquid environments**
- **Plasmids**: Bacterial cells can contain small, circular **pieces**(part) of **DNA** called plasmids. Plasmids *carry genes* 



# Eukaryotic E.G. Animal Cell 
![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231120214045.png]]
Components : 
1. Cell Membrane.
2. Nucleus.
3. Cytoplasm.
4. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).
5. Golgi Apparatus.
6. Mitochondria.
7. Lysosomes.
8. Centrioles.
9. Vacuoles 
10. Peroxisomes
11. Cytoskeleton

*additional specialized structure are also present in **Eukaryotic** cells Like how **flagella** in **sperm** cell*
## Peroxisomes 
Peroxisomes are **small vesicles**, **single membrane**-bound organelles .
- They contain : 
	- **digestive enzymes** for breaking down **toxic** materials in the cell 
	-  **oxidative enzymes** for **metabolic** activity. 
- Peroxisomes play an important role in ==**lipid** production==
- and are also involved in the conversion of **reactive oxygen species** such as *hydrogen peroxide* into **safer** molecules like *water* and *oxygen* by the **enzyme *catalase*.**[^1]
### Shapes of peroxisome 
1. Mostly peroxisomes occur as an **individual organelle**, e.g. in **fibroblasts**.
2. hey also exist in the form of **interconnected tubules** in **liver** cells known as **peroxisome reticulum**.
![[MD/1 year/anatomy/HDTD/res/Pasted image 20231119192902.png|*]]

[^1]: Catalase is **a key enzyme which uses hydrogen peroxide, a nonradical ROS, as its substrate**. This enzyme is responsible for neutralization through decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, thereby maintaining an optimum level of the molecule in the cell which is also essential for cellular signaling processes


## Cytoskeleton 
Cytoskeleton: is a **network of protein filaments** and **tubules** that provides
- structural **support** to the cell
- maintains its **shape**,
-  facilitates intracellular **transport** 
- cell **movement**

# Functions OF Cells 
- **Nutrient Intake and Metabolism**: Cells take in nutrients from their environment and break them down through metabolic processes to produce **energy**, **molecules**, and **building blocks** *necessary for growth and maintenance*.
	- **Energy Production**: Cells generate energy through processes like 
		- **cellular respiration** (in **mitochondria**) 
		- **photosynthesis** (in **plant** cells).
	- **Synthesis of Molecules**: Cells synthesize 
		- **proteins**, 
		- **lipids**, 
		- **carbohydrates**.
- **Storage and Transport**: Cells store **nutrients**, **ions**, and transport them within the cell and between cells
- **Response to Stimuli**: Cells can detect and respond to external stimuli , e.g. ==**nerve cells**== 
- **Cell Division**: Cells divide to reproduce, *grow*, and *repair* damaged tissues
	- **DNA Replication**: Cells replicate their DNA during cell division
- **Hormone Production**: Some cells produce hormones that **regulate** various physiological processes
- **Defense and Immune Response**: *Immune cells* defend the body against pathogens by **identifying** and **neutralizing** *foreign bodies*
