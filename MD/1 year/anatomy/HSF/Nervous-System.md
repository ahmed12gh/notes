The nervous system is the most complex body system !! Constantly alive with electricity, the nervous system is the body's prime communication and coordination network.
It is so vast and complex that, an estimate is that all the individual nerves from one body, joined end to end, could reach around the world two and a half times.
- The *Brain* and *Spinal Cord* are the **Central Nervous System**.
- *Nerves* and *Sensory Organs* Make Up the **Peripheral Nervous System**. 
	1. Automatic : self regulated internal organs and glands 
		- sympathic : arousing
		- parasympathic : calming
	2. Somatic : voluntary  

# Central Nervous System 
The Spinal Cord Transmits Signals to and from the Brain and Commands Reflexes
## Spinal Cord 

1. The spinal cord is an 
	- **elongated cylinder** of neuron cell bodies, 
	- bundles of axons and other cells, 
	- protected by connective tissue and bone.
1. It connects to the brain at the ***medulla oblongata*** and runs down the vertebral column[^1], 
2. serves as a kind of superhighway
3. **Sensory information** and **motor commands** travel up and down, heading to and from the brain. These signals speed in and out of the spinal cord 
4. Some incoming **signals demand a simple, immediate response**. The *spinal cord* can shoot out a reflex command ==without bothering the brain==, called a ***Reflex Arc***

[^1]:the hollow tunnel enclosed within the vertebrae of the spine , It's made up of **33 vertebrae**

### SPINAL NERVES 
- The **31** pairs of peripheral spinal nerves emerge from the spinal cord *through spaces between the vertebrae.*
- Each nerve **divides and subdivides** into a number of branches; 
	- the *dorsal* branches serve the **rear** portion of the body, 
	- while the *ventral* serve the **front and sides**. 
	- The branches of one **spinal nerve may join with other nerves** to form **meshes** called *plexuses* where information is shared. 
	- The plexuses send signals along secondary nerve branches to
		- areas of complex function or 
		- movement 

### What Is a Dermatome 
- A dermatome is the **area of the skin** of the human anatomy that is *mainly supplied by branches of a **single** spinal sensory nerve root*
- These spinal sensory nerves 
	- enter the nerve root at the spinal cord, 
	- and their branches reach to the outside areas of the body
- The sensory nerves in that area are a type of nerve that
	- **transmits signals from sensations** (Eg., pain symptoms, touch, temperature) to the spinal cord *from specific areas of our anatomy*.
- Cerical region C1 - C8
- Thoracic region  T1- T12
- Lumbar  region  L1 - L5
- Sacral region  S1 - S5

##  The Brain 
In some ways, the human brain resembles a computer. But in addition to logical processing, it is capable of complex development, learning, self-awareness, emotion, and creativity.
- The front and back views reveal the **longitudinal fissureالشق** dividing the brain into *two hemispheres* 
- The surface of the *cerebrum* is folded into **ridges and grooves**. The *cerebellum* lies beneath the cerebrum. The *brainstem* and top of the *spinal cord* are also visible
- 12 pairs of *cranial nerves* connect the brain to **eyes, ears**, and other **sensory organs** and to **head** and **neck muscles**

# Peripheral Nervous System 
## Sight, Sound, Smell, Taste, and Touch:
The nervous system must receive and process information about the world outside in order to react, **communicate**, and **keep the body healthy and safe**. Much of this information comes through the **sensory organs**: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin.
Specialized cells and tissues within these organs *receive raw stimuli* and *translate them into signals* the nervous system can use. *Nerves relay the signals* to the **brain**, which interprets them as sight (vision), sound (hearing), smell (olfaction), taste (gustation), and touch (tactile perception).
