The nervous system is the most complex
body system !!
Constantly alive with electricity, the nervous
system is the body's prime communication
and coordination network.
It is so vast and complex that, an estimate
is that all the individual nerves from one
body, joined end to end, could reach around
the world two and a half times.
• The Brain and Spinal Cord are the Central
Nervous System.
• Nerves and Sensory Organs Make Up the
Peripheral Nervous System.
