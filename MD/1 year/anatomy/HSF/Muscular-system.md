There are over 600 muscles in the human body. Account for about *Half of our body weight* 
Muscles have a range of functions 
- from pumping blood and
- supporting movement to
- lifting heavy weights or
- giving birth.

Muscles work by either contracting or relaxing to cause movement. This movement may be
- voluntary (meaning the movement is made consciously) or
- done without our conscious awareness (involuntary 

# Different types of muscle
1. **Skeletal muscle**  : 
	-  tissue that is attached to bones and allows movement. 
	- skeletal muscles and bones are called the **musculoskeletal** system (also  **locomotor** system). 
	-  grouped into *opposing pairs* such as the **biceps** and **triceps** on the front and back of the upper arm.
	- Skeletal muscles are *under our conscious control*, which is why they are also known as **voluntary** muscles. 
	- Another term is **striated** muscles, since the tissue looks **striped** when viewed under a microscope
1. **Smooth muscle** : 
	- located in various **internal structures** including the *digestive tract*, *uterus* and *blood vessels* such as arteries. 
	- Smooth muscle is arranged in **layered sheets** that contract in **waves** along the **length** of the structure.
	- Another common term is **involuntary muscle**, since the motion of smooth muscle happens without our conscious awareness
1. **Cardiac muscle** : the muscle specific to the heart. The heart contracts and relaxes without our conscious awareness 

# Skeletal Muscles 
- skeletal muscles are connected to the skeleton,
	- either to **bone** or to 
	- connective tissues such as **ligaments**. 
- Muscles are always attached at *two or more places*.
	- When the muscle **contracts**, the attachment points are *pulled closer together*;
	- when it **relaxes**, the attachment points *move apart* 
- Each skeletal muscle has an *Origin*  (the attachment to a fixed bone, usually the proximal attachment) and *Insertion*, Has *belly* and *tendon*
- Each muscle consist of 
	- **Bundles** called *Fascicles* 
		- which consists of **Fibers** covered by **connective tissue investments** (*Epimysium*, *Perimysium*, *Endomysium*) 
		- **==rich with blood supply, innervated by nerves and synapses==**[^1] responsible for the contraction so called the **Neuromuscular system**

[^1]:the points of contact between neurons where information is passed from one neuron to the next

# Skeletal Muscle Shapes 
1. ==**Circular Muscles**==   appear circular in shape and are
	- normally **sphincter العاصرة** muscles that surround an opening
	- as the mouth surrounded by *Obicularis Oris*  
	- *Obicularis Oculi* surrounding the eyes
2. ==**Convergent Muscles**== 
	- These are muscles where the *origin is wider than the point of insertion*.
	- *==This fiber arrangement allows for maximum force production==*.
	-  sometimes known as **triangular muscles**.
	- Eg. *Pectoralis Major*.
1. ==**Parallel Muscles**== 
	-  fibers  run parallel to each other
	-  sometimes called **strap** muscles(resamable a strap or belt). 
	- They are normally long muscles which cause **large movements**, and are **not** very strong but have **good endurance**.
	- Eg.  *Sartorius* and *Sternocleidomastoid*
1. ==**Pennate Muscles**== :
	- Pennate muscles have a **large number of muscle fibers** per unit and so are **very strong**, but **tire easily**.
	1. *==Uni-pennate==*: These muscles have their fibers arranged to insert in a **diagonal** direction onto the **tendon**, *which allows great strength*. 
		-  The *Lumbricals* (deep hand muscles) 
		- *Extensor Digitorum Communis* (wrist and finger extensor)
	1.  *==Bi-pennate==*: Bipennate muscles have **two rows** of muscle fibers, facing in **opposite diagonal** directions, with a **central tendon**, like a feather. 
		- This allows even greater power but less range of motion.
		- Like the *Rectus Femoris* 
	3. *==Multi-pennate==*:  have multiple rows of diagonal fibers, with a central tendon that **branches into two or more tendons.**
		- Eg. *Deltoid* muscle which has *three sections*, anterior, posterior, and middle.
1. ==**Fusiform Muscles**== Sometimes, included in the parallel muscle group, 
	- these muscles are more spindle- shaped, 
	- with the muscle belly being wider than the origin and insertion.
	- Examples are, **Biceps Brachii** and **Psoas major**.
