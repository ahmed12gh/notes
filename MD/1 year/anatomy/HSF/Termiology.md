# The Standerd refernce point of view 
Standing erect, with the feet parallel and the arms hanging at the sides with the palms facing forward

# planes 
1. sagittal planes ( vertical) 
	1. para-sagittal plane : away from the center or middle line  
	2. mid-sagittal plane : directly in the midline 
2. transverse (horizontal) plane : divides the body into **superior**  and **inferior** 
3. oblique planes : obliques are odd angles are mostly used in limbs 
4. coronal planes : vertical plane perpendicaular to the sagittal plane

# Angular movements 
-  **Flexion** and **extension** : in flexion there is decrease in angle between the articulating bones مفصل العظم while in extension there is an increase in the angle , **flexion** is movement of limb **away** from the **trunk** while extension is **toward** it.
- **Abduction** & ==A**d**duction== :  Abduction is the movement away from the midline whereas **add**uction is the movement toward the midline 
- **Circumduction** is the movement of the distal end of the body around a circle(conical shape) , **continuous sequence of flexion, abduction,extension and adduction**(بالتسلسل حفظ). (F.AB.E.A)

- **Rotation** means that the bone revolves around its own longitudinal axis
	- **medial** (internal) rotation : If the anterior surface of the limb is turned toward the midline
	- **lateral** (external ) rotation : f the anterior surface of the limb is turned away from the midline

## Special Movements at specific joints 
- **elevation**, **depression** : at the temporomandibular joint (closing and opening mouth) shoulders ( shrugging )
- **protraction** (forth), **retraction**(back to the anatomical position) : to draw froth or back as in protract the **mandible** or **clavicles** الترقوة  by crossing and extening ur arms 
- **inversion**  (inward), **eversion**(outward) :  soles medially **or** laterally  at the **intertarsal joints** (between the tarsals)
- **dorsiflexion**(dorsum الخلفي للقدم ), **planter flexion** bending of the foot :
	NOTE: dorsiflexion is true flexion, whereas planter flexion is true extension.
	
-  **supination**, **pronation** : proximal and distal **radioulnar** joints ![|400](MD/1%20year/anatomy/HSF/Resources/Pasted%20image%2020231114213602.png) 
> The Kings Pronate The beggers Supinate
- **opposition** :is the movement of the thumb at the carpometacarpal joint in which the thumb moves across the palm to touch the tips of the fingers on the same hand. This gives the ability to grasp and manipulate objects .
