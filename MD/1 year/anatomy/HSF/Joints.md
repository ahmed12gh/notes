A joint (articulation) is a point of contact between two bones
# Strutural classification  
type of connective tissue that combines the bones together whether there is a space between the articulating bones or not ( **synovial cavity**)
- **Fibrous  joint**
	- sutures 
	- syndesmoses 
	- gomphosis 
- **cartilaginous joint**
	- synchondroses  
	- symphysis
- **synovial joint**
# Functional classification 
by degree of movement they permit
- **Synarthrosis**  An immovable joint
- **Amphiarthrosis**  A slightly movable joint
- **Diarthrosis**  A freely movable joint , all **Diarthrosis** are **Synovial** joints

# Fibrous joints 
the bones are held together by **fibrous connective tissue** and the is no synovial cavity
- **Sutures** : as the **sagittal suture** or the **coronal suture** of the **skull** which is immovable so they are classified functionally as **synarthrosis** 
- **Syndesmoses** : (band or ligament) there is a greater distance between the articulating bones and more fibrous connective tissue than in **sutures**. 
	- Because it allows slight movement it is classified functionally as an **amphiarthrosis**
	- The **interossous** membrane between the parallel borders of **radius** and **ulna** bone ( *==middle==* **radioulnar** joint)
	- between the parallel borders of the **tibia** and **fibula** ( **middle tibiofibular** joint). 
- **Gomphosis** : is a type of fibrous joint in which ==a cone-shape peg fits into a socket==. 
	- A gomphosis is classified functionally as a **synarthrosis**, an **immovable** joint.
	- The only example in the body is the **roots of teeth** and their **sockets** in the **maxilla**(**upper jaw**) and the **mandible** bones.

# Cartilaginous joints
the bones are held together by cartilage and the is no synovial cavity
1. **Synchondroses** : 
	- Functionally it is classified as a **synarthrosis**.
	- like the **epiphyseal plate** that connects the epiphysis with the diaphysis of the long bone. 
	- Other ex. Is the joint between the ==first rib and the sternum bone==[^1].
2. **Symphyses** :
	- in which the ends of the articulating bones are covered by **hyaline cartilage**, but the bones are connected by a **broad, flat disc of fibrocartilage**.
	- All symphyses are present in the **midline** of the body, 
		- The joint between the **manubrium**(first part of sternum) and the **body** (part  of the sternum),
		- the joint between the two hip bones called **pubic symphyses**, 
		- the joints between the bodies of the **vertebrae** forming the intervertebral joints. 
	- A symphysis is an **amphiarthrosis**, slightly movable joint.

# Synovial joints  (Diarthrosis) 
bones are held together by **capsule** and **ligaments** . The structure of these joints allows the bones to **move freely**, so all of them are **diarthrosis**. They have a space called the synovial (joint) cavity between the articulating bones.
1. The bones at the synovial joint are covered by **articular cartilage**, which is hyaline cartilage. 
	- This cartilage provides a smooth, slippery surface for the articulating bones, but it does not bind them together. 
	- It reduces the friction between the bones of the joint during movement and helps to absorb shock.
2. There is also the **articular capsule** surrounds a synovial joint 
	- encloses the synovial cavity and unites the articulating bones. 
	- It is composed of two layers, 
		-  **outer fibrous capsule** ,The outer layer is *fibrous, tougher* than the inner layer and ==attaches to the periosteum== of the articulating bones,
		-  **inner synovial membrane**. while the inner layer is **areolar** with **elastic fibers**.
3. The **synovial fluid** is secreted from the ***synovial membrane***, 
	- it is a thin film of fluid present in the synovial (joint) cavity,
		- *viscous, clear or pale yellow* fluid similar in appearance and consistency to *uncooked egg white or albumin*. 
		- It consists of **hyaluronic acid**.
	- Its several functions are 
		- reducing friction, lubricating the joint, 
		- supplying nutrients and removing waste products 
		- has **phagocytic cells** that remove *microbes* and debris that *result from tear in the joint*. 
	- When a synovial joint is **immobile** the synovial fluid becomes **gel-like** but as joint *movement increases the fluid becomes less viscous*
4. Many synovial joints also contain **accessory ligaments** 
	- *extra capsular* ligaments . lies outside the articular capsule
	- *intra-capsular* ligaments.  lies within the articular capsule **but are excluded from the synovial cavity** by **folds of the synovial membrane**

## Nerve and Blood supply of the joint 
The nerves that supply a joint are the same as those that supply the skeletal muscles that move the joint. Some nerve endings convey information about pain in the joint, others are responsive to the degree of movement and stretch at a joint 
 
>  The **Nerve** supplying the muscles extending directly across and acting at a given joint not only supplies the muscle, but also **innervates the joint** and the **skin overlying the muscle**
>  `Hilton's law`

 **Nearby arteries** are responsible for ==nourishing the joint with oxygen and nutrients== and the **veins** ==carry out carbon dioxide and waste products== from the joint. The arteries send out numerous branches that **penetrate the ligaments and articular capsule**. We should know that the * **articulating portions** of the synovial joint receives its nourishment from the **synovial fluid** * whereas all other joint tissues are supplied by **blood capillaries**

## Types of synovial joints

1. Planer : Planar joints are found in the carpal bones in the hand and the tarsal bones of the foot, as well as between vertebrae
2. Hinge : elbow
3. Pivot  : first and second vertebrae of the neck
4. Condyloid[^2] : in the joints of the wrist and fingers
5. Saddle : thumb joint
6. Ball-and-socket joints  : shoulder and hip joints

## Types of Movements at synovial joints
The movements are grouped into four main categories:
1. Gliding
2. Angular movements.
3. Rotation.
4. Special movements. This last category includes movements that only occur at certain joints
