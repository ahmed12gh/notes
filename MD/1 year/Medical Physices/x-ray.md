# X-ray tube 
## X-ray heart 
The heart of an X-ray machine is an electrode pair a **cathode and an anode** that sits inside a **glass vacuum tube**.As the *electrical current flows* through the tube from cathode to anode, the **electrons** undergo an **energy loss**, which results in generation of x-rays . 

### The Anode
The anode is the component in which the x- radiation is produced.It is a relatively large piece of metal that connects to the positive side of the electrical circuit.**The anode has two primary functions:**
- to convert **electronic** energy into x- radiation, and 
- to **dissipate** the **heat** created in the process. 

The anode is tilted at an angle of **12** to **17** degrees in order to
- maximise the contact area 
- focussing the resultant beam

*corrrect warm up and stand precedures are essential to maximize tube and filament life time* .

#### Materials used and why 
The material for the anode is selected to enhance these functions. The anode is usually composed of **tungsten** or **molybdenum** as it must withstand very **high** temperatures (>3000 degrees C)

#### Efficiency factor
The fraction of the total *electronic energy that is converted into x-radiation* (efficiency) depends on two factors: 
- the **atomic number** (Z) of the anode material 
- the **energy of the electrons**

#### Tungsten in past and current years  
 Most x-ray tubes use tungsten,  **atomic number of 74**.
- Tungsten is almost unique in its ability to 
	- **maintain its strength at high temperatures**, and it has a 
	- **high melting point** 
	- and a relatively **low rate of evaporation**
	
In recent years an alloy of **tungsten** and **rhenium** has been used as the target material but only for the surface of some anodes
 
*The anode body under the tungsten-rhenium* surface on many tubes is manufactured from a material that is **relatively light and has good heat storage capability**. such materials are **molybdenum** and **graphite**.They use molybdenum as an anode base material

*Most x-ray tubes used for **mammography**[^1] have **molybdenum-surface anodes** *.

==Does the density of the target material matter==?
*important characteristic of the target material is its density*. The material must be of high atomic mass **for electron interaction**. when the electron interacts with the target atoms the result is the generation of X-rays.
Low density materials do not provide sufficient density for interaction.

#### Desgin of Anode  
Most anodes are shaped as **beveled disks** and attached to the **shaft** of an **electric motor** that rotates them at relatively high speeds ; to **dissipate heat**

##### Focal Spot 
Not all of the anode is involved in x-ray production. The ==radiation is produced in a very small area== on the surface of the anode known as the focal spot. 
The dimensions of the focal spot are determined by the **dimensions of the electron beam** arriving from the **cathode**.
In most x-ray tubes, the focal spot is **approximately rectangular**.
The dimensions of focal spots usually range from **0.1 mm** to **2 mm**.
- **small** focal spots produce **less blurring** and better visibility of detail, amount of radiation needed is relatively low because of small and thin body regions as in mammography.
- **large** focal spots have a **greater heat-dissipating** capacity.

**Focal spot size is** one factor that must be considered when selecting an x-ray tube for a specific application.Most x-ray tubes have two focal spot sizes (small and large), which can be selected by the operator according to the imaging procedure.

### The Cathode  
The cathode is the negative terminal of the tube assembly and includes the **filament**, which is a small- coiled wire that is commonly made from **tungsten**. 
The filament **provides the electrons** for acceleration toward  target (anode). The filament is normally powered by an **AC** that is supplied to it by a **separate transformer**.

The *basic function* of the cathode is to 
- **expel** the electrons from the electrical circuit  
- **focus** them into a well- defined **beam** aimed at the anode.

The typical cathode consists of a small coil of wire (a filament) recessedwithin A cup-shaped region 

current supplied to the filament ranges from a **few hundred micro-amperes** to several **mille-amperes (mA)**.*==Filament current may be varied or fixed to maintain a constant tube current.==*
Adjustments in current to the filament varies the number of electrons that will boil off the filament. This in turn controls the number of X-rays that the tube is generating. **Filament current controls the X-ray intensity**

#### Cathode consist of 
A spiral of heated low resistance (R) tungsten wire (filament) for electron emission. Wire is heated by filament current
#### Calculations 

$$ 
I = \frac{V}{R}
$$
*==Ex==*.-Find the resistance of an x-ray wire, if you know that V=2V, I=0.5

# Thermionic emission 
Electrons that flow through electrical circuits **cannot** generally escape from the conductor material and move into free space. They can if they are given **sufficient** energy, **thermal energy** (or heat) is used to **expel** the electrons from the cathode. The filament of the cathode is heated in the **same** way as a **light bulb** filament by passing a current through it. 

This *heating current* is **not** the same as the *current flowing through the x- ray tube* (the MA) that produces the x-radiation. During tube operation, the cathode is heated to a **glowing** temperature.
# Envelope 
The anode and cathode are contained in an airtight enclosure, or envelope. The majority of x-ray tubes have **glass** envelopes, other are **metal** and **ceramic** envelopes
