## ABSTRACT

Bone density measurements using computed tomography (CT) instead of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) are currently of great interest in human and veterinary medical research as it would be beneficial to use CT scans obtained for other indications also for determining bone density. For Hounsfield units (HU) measured with CT in specific regions of interests (ROIs) in one or several slice/s a correlation with bone mineral density (BMD) measured by DEXA in humans and dogs of between 0.44 and 0.77 is reported in the literature. In the present study, instead certain volumes of interest (VOIs) obtained by CT scan and the corresponding HU to the respective VOIs were compared with the bone mineral density of the corresponding areas measured by DEXA. The aim of the study was to investigate whether this procedure gives more accurate information about bone density of the bones as three-dimensional objects of the respective patient. Correlation between measured HU in the respective VOI and BMD measured with DEXA in the corresponding ROI showed a very good correlation of 0.93. Linear regression with _R_2 = 0.85 (_p_ = 0.0262) was calculated. Except for VOI5, similar distribution of values and significant differences (_p_ < 0.0001–0.0087) between ROIs/VOIs were detected. Determining HU for assessing bone mineral density in a certain volume provides more accurate results than those previously reported from two-dimensional (2D) CT measurements. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

# Intro 

Measuring bone density with computed tomography instead of using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) has become a focus of interest in the last few years in human and veterinary medicine.[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0001)-[13](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0013) 

However, according to the World Health Organization, the **gold standard** for **quantitative measurements of bone density** is *dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry* (DEXA).[14](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0014), [15](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0015) Both modalities (DEXA and CT) are based on X-radiation. However, ==DEXA produces a two-dimensional (2D)== image of a three-dimensional (3D) object using two energies (100 and 140 kV in this study) simultaneously that are differently absorbed by tissue. The produced image is the result of the radiation absorption of the respective tissue which depends on its density and thickness.[16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0016) The higher the density and thickness of the tissue, the greater is the absorption. 

Depending on **how much radiation reaches the detector**, every pixel of the image is assigned with a **grey** value depending on the *attenuation value*.[16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0016) Due to the **two different energies** simultaneously used in DEXA, ==every pixel includes two different attenuation values==. The DEXA software automatically recognizes bone tissue and the two different attenuation values for the recognized bone area are processed into information about bone mineral content (g).
Bone mineral density (BMD) is calculated by the software *==dividing the measured bone mineral content by the area recognized as bone in g/cm2.==* 

DEXA is usually performed in the **spine** or **hip** in humans, both **areas of major fracture risk in the elderly** or in people with *osteoporosis*.[17](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0017) Additionally, DEXA has been used to evaluate **bone remodeling** **processes** after total hip replacement in the **periprosthetic femur** in humans and dogs.[18](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0018)-[20](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0020)

Although there are studies measuring bone density in dogs using DEXA,[21](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0021), [22](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0022) lack of its availability and trained personnel remain huge challenges for its applicability in veterinary medicine. Therefore, several veterinary studies have focused on the use of CT for assessing bone density in a wide variety of canine bones such as vertebrae,[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0003), [4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0004), [23](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0023)-[26](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0026) femoral head,[6](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0006), [27](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0027), [28](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0028) radius and ulna,[29](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0029), [30](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0030) knee,[31](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0031) mandibula and maxilla,[32](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0032) and tarsus.[7](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0007) Although the obtained CT image also depends on the absorption of X-radiation, in contrast to DEXA a 3D replication of the scanned object is produced using a standardized linear attenuation coefficient scale, where air is defined as −1,000 and water as 0, expressed in HU. 

Also, in human medicine, the use of CT scans obtained for other indications (e.g., CT colonography) to determine bone density is of high interest in current research.[8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0008)-[13](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0013), [24](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0024), [25](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0025), [30](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0030), [33](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0033), [34](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0034) All these studies have in ==common the fact that the HU of a defined 2D region of interest (ROI) is measured in a single or in multiple slice(s).== The reported correlation of bone density measured with CT (in HU) and DEXA (BMD in g/cm2) in human patients ranges between 0.44 and 0.77.[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0001), [5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0005), [21](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0021) In one previous study comparing contrast enhanced CT to DEXA, a correlation ($r^2$) of 0.824 was found between the modalities.[13](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0013) To the authors’ knowledge in the available literature, no study has investigated the correlation between mean HU of a corresponding volume of g (VOI) in CT and the projected ROI in the area in DEXA. The present study was therefore designed to investigate the comparability between HU measured in defined volumes (VOIs) of the proximal femur in CT and BMD measured with DEXA for measuring bone density. The hypothesis of the study was that CT-based HU measurements of a bone VOI show a better correlation with respective DEXA BMD measurements than CT measurements of HU in corresponding 2D ROIs. Therefore, HU of a designated volume within five predifined areas of canine femora were compared with BMD values obtained from DEXA scans of the respective ROI of the bone.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Femora مو مهم 

A total of 30 normal femora of 15 dog cadavers (3 Alsatians, 3 mixed breed dogs, 2 Golden Retrievers, 2 Small Munsterlanders, 2 Irish Setters, 2 English Bulldogs, and 1 Border Collie) which were euthanized because of medical reasons unrelated to this study, met the inclusion criteria of the study reported here. Mean M (±standard deviation SD) body weight of enrolled cadavers was 26.4 (±5.6) kg. No exclusion criteria existed as the comparison between HU and BMD was performed separately for every femur. Both femora of each dog were explanted and any soft tissue was removed. All bone specimens were measured using DEXA and computed tomography for quantitative analysis of bone mineral density. Up to the time of examination, the femora were wrapped in a cloth soaked with 0.9% saline solution and frozen at −20°C. Prior to analysis, femora were thawed for at least 12 h at room temperature.

### DEXA Measurements

DEXA measurements were performed with the scanning mode “metal hip removal” of a Hologic Discovery A S/N 80600 device (Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA). For the anterioposterior positioning, the respective femur was rotated medially about 20° to prevent the femoral neck from superimposing with the femoral head.[18](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0018), [19](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0019) Each femur was scanned in this position from proximal to distal in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations for human bones by using a fan-beam mode (100 and 140 kV). Evaluation of DEXA images was performed using the integrated software of the mentioned DEXA device (Hologic Inc.). For analyses of DEXA images, five regions of interest (ROIs; modified Gruen zones[35](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0035)) were adapted to each canine femur as previously described (Fig. [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-fig-0001), left).[36](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0036), [37](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0037) A detailed determination of these ROIs is described in the study of Lucas et al.[38](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0038)

Definition of ROIs/VOIs. Left: DEXA image of femur 17 (Alsatian, 24 kg, right femur) in anterioposterior position, femur rotated medially about 20°; R1–R5 = region of interest 1–5. Right: Three-dimensional reconstruction based on CT scan of femur 17 (Alsatian, 24 kg, right femur); red: VOI1; yellow: VOI2; green: VOI3; blue: VOI4; purple: VOI5.

### CT Measurements

CT measurements were performed using a CT scanner (Philips Brilliance 64 CT Scanner, Philips Healthcare, Hamburg, Germany) with the highest possible resolution (scanning mode “carpus/tarsus”). Femora were positioned on the CT table as described above for DEXA measurements and scanned from the proximal end to the distal end of the femur. Obtained images were exported in DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format. For analyses of CT data, an open source image analysis program (YaDiV®, Welfenlab, Hannover, Germany[39](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0039)) was used to segment each femur. The segment of each femur was loaded in Catia V5 (Dassault Systèmes, Vélizy-Villacoublay, France) to create 3D volumes of interest (VOIs) representing the five ROIs analyzed by DEXA (Fig. [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-fig-0001), right). Thus the mean HU for each VOI was determined corresponding to BMD measured for each ROI in DEXA.

### Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism (version 6). Pearson's correlation coefficient (_r_) and linear regression (_R_2) were calculated between mean BMD (DEXA) and mean HU (CT) in the five regions/volumes of interest for every femur. The correlation coefficient ranged from 0 to 1. Correlation was considered as follows: _r_ = 0 → no correlation; 0 < _r_ ≤ 0.2 → very poor correlation; 0.2 < _r_ ≤ 0.4 → poor correlation; 0.4 < _r_ ≤ 0.6 → moderate correlation; 0.6 < _r_ ≤ 0.8 → good correlation; 0.8 < _r_< 1 → very good correlation; _r_ = 1 perfect correlation. One-way ANOVA was performed to analyze differences between the different ROIs (DEXA) and VOIs (CT), followed by a post-hoc Tukey test. For better comparison HU were divided by 1,000. Differences in comparisons were considered as statistically significant in case of the following significance levels: _p_ < 0.05 (*); _p_ < 0.01 (**), _p_ < 0.001 (***), ns is used when no statistical significance is detected (_p_ > 0.05).

## RESULTS

Scatterplot. Scatterplot of Hounsfield units (HU) divided by 1,000 and BMD (g/cm2) data of the 30 femora with linear regression curve. Linear regression equation is HU = 1,627 × BMD − 255.6 with _R_2 = 0.85 and _p_ = 0.0262 (significance levels: _p_ < 0.05; _p_ < 0.01, _p_ < 0.001).

Statistically significant differences between the ROIs/VOIs for DEXA and CT are shown in Figure [4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-fig-0004) (**_p_ < 0.01; ***_p_ < 0.001). Bone mineral density (BMD) measured by DEXA differed significantly (_p_ < 0.0001–0.0087) between the five ROIs (Table [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-tbl-0001 "Link to table"), Fig. [4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-fig-0004), left). The values of HU calculated by CT also differed significantly (_p_ < 0.0001–0.0019) between the five VOIs (Table [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-tbl-0001 "Link to table"), Fig. [4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-fig-0004), right). Region and volume of interest 1 (ROI1 and VOI1) showed the lowest values of BMD and HU, respectively, among the five regions and volumes of interest. Mean values of ROI2/ROI5 were similar and identical in ROI3/ROI4 in DEXA measurements (0.74/0.73 and 0.79/0.79 g/cm2, respectively). Nearly identical values were measured in VOI3/VOI4 with CT (1.04 and 1.05 (×1000) HU) but the mean value of VOI5 was significantly lower than in VOI2 (VOI5 = 0.85 (×1000) HU; VOI2 = 0.98 (×1000) HU; _p_ = 0.0019).

## DISCUSSION

Current attempts to determine bone density using data of CT scans from humans and dogs are based on the comparison of HU measured in a region of interest in 2D in one up to three slice(s) and report a correlation range between CT (HU) and DEXA (BMD in g/cm2) of 0.44–0.77.[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0001), [5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0005), [21](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0021) To achieve a better correlation between CT and DEXA results it appears logical to compare bone density values from the projected area in DEXA to the HU from the whole corresponding volume (3D) in CT. DEXA is traditionally the most commonly used method for density measurements in bones.[21](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0021), [23](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0023), [40](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0040) Nevertheless, in the last few years, research in human medicine has focused on measuring bone density using CT (in HU).[33](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0033), [34](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0034) Thus, CT images obtained for other indications (e.g., colonography) can be used for assessing bone mineral density, thus saving the patient from experiencing additional radiation exposure for the DEXA investigation.[33](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0033) This is an interesting topic, especially for veterinary medicine, where availability of DEXA devices and trained personnel are low. The aim of this study was to investigate whether HU measured in a 3D volume correlate with BMD of the corresponding 2D region of interest.

In this study, a very good correlation (_r_ = 0.93) was determined between area projected density measured with DEXA and the corresponding HU of the 3D volume in CT. A linear regression equation for mean values with _R_2 = 0.85 was determined. The distribution of measured values showed similar tendencies in both modalities for all VOIs. In VOI5, significantly lower values were measured by CT compared to VOI2. This difference was not detected between ROI5 and ROI2 in DEXA. VOI5 is the largest volume including the femoral head and due to its size probably has a greater margin for error. Nevertheless, the results show that measuring HU in a volume in CT gives accurate results of the bone density. Furthermore, substantial evidence is given that it is possible to use CT data of the femur, originally obtained for other indications for measuring bone density. However, it still has to be verified whether these results can be transferred 1:1 to a clinical examination of legs surrounded by tissue in living dogs. Technically, the used techniques can be easily adapted to patient investigations. Nevertheless, further studies using whole legs are necessary to investigate whether there is any influence of surrounding soft tissue.

Quantitative measurements of bone density in dogs are of interest for evaluating bone remodeling processes around implants or endocrinological or food-depending effects on bone mineralization.[23](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0023), [24](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0024), [36](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.23574#jor23574-bib-0036) General anaesthesia is required for DEXA as well as for CT when investigating animal patients in order to reduce motion artefacts. One major limitation of the CT applicability for bone density measurements in dogs is its higher radiation exposure in comparison to DEXA. However, CT has gained wider acceptance in veterinary practices as a commonly used diagnostic tool than DEXA has. In human medicine, it is especially interesting to use CT data obtained for other indications to predict fracture risks due to low bone density in order to protect patients from further radiation exposure due to an additional DEXA scan.

## CONCLUSIONS

Measuring bone density in a designated volume of interest in CT data sets is possible. This study shows a very good correlation between CT (HU) and DEXA (BMD in g/cm2), indicating that measuring HU using individual volumes (VOIs) provide more accurate results than measuring HU in one/multiple slice/s (2D) as reported in the literature. The results of this study indicate that CT is an accurate method for measuring bone density which can be used, for example, in future studies on endocrinological or food-depending effects on bone mineralization.
