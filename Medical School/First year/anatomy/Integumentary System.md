# Skin 
- the superficial part, the **epidermis**, and the deep part, the **dermis** .
- The appendages of the skin are the **nails** , **hair follicles** , **sweet glands** , **sebaceous الدهنية glands** 
- The skin over **joints** ==always folds in the same place==, the **skin creases** .At these sites, the skin is thinner than elsewhere and is firmly tethered مربوطة to underlying structures by **strong bands of fibrous** tissue 


## Epidermis 
The **epidermis** is a **stratified epithelium** whose cells become **flattened** as they mature and rise to the surface 
- On the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, the epidermis is extremely **thick**, to ==withstand the wear and tear== that occurs in these regions 
-  on the **anterior surface of the arm** and forearm, it is **thin**.
## Dermis 
The dermis is composed of **dense connective tissue** containing many blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves.
tending to be thinner on the **anterior** than on the **posterior** surface. It is **thinner** in **women** than in men.

# Fasciae
The dermis of the skin is connected to the underlying **deep fascia** or **bones** by the  **superficial** fascia, otherwise known as **sub-cutaneous تحت الجلد** tissue.
## superficial fascia 
is a mixture of **loose areolar** and **adipose** tissue unites the dermis to the underlying deep fascia 
- In scalp فروة الرأس, the back of the neck, palms of the hands,  soles of  feet contains numerous bundles of **collagen fibers** hold the skin firmly to the deeper structures (bones and muscles)
- In  eyelids, auricle (outer) of the ear, penis and scrotum, and clitoris, it is ==devoid of adipose tissue==.![[Medical School/First year/anatomy/Resources/Pasted image 20231115135333.png]]![[Medical School/First year/anatomy/Resources/Pasted image 20231115135519.png|200]]
## Deep facsia 
 is a **membranous** layer of **connective tissue** that invests(covers) the muscles and other deep structures. 
- In **neck**, it forms well-defined layers , **determining** the **path** taken by **pathogenic** organisms during the spread of **infection**.
- In  **thorax** and **abdomen**, it is  thin film of **areolar** tissue covering the muscles and [aponeurosis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23407-aponeurosis)( **connective tissue**  similir tendons act as facsia )
- In the **limbs**, it forms a definite sheath around the muscles and other structures, holding them in place
- **Fibrous septa** extend from the deep surface of the membrane, between the groups of muscles, and in many places divide the interior of the limbs into compartments ![[Medical School/First year/anatomy/Resources/Pasted image 20231115154719.png|400]]
- In the region of joints, the deep fascia may be considerably thickened to form restraining bands called **retinacula** Their function is to hold underlying tendons in position or to serve as pulleys(to retain) around which the tendons may move.
