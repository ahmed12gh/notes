# strutural classification  
- type of connective tissue that combines the bones together
- whether there is a space between the articulating bones or not ( synovial cavity)
### Fibrous joints 
the bones are held together by fibrous connective tissue and the is no synovial cavity
#### Types of fibrous joints 
- **Sutures** : as the **sagittal suture** or the **coronal suture** of the **skull** which is immovable so they are classified functionally as **synarthrosis** 
- **Syndesmoses** : (band or ligament) there is a greater distance between the articulating bones and more fibrous connective tissue than in **sutures**. 
	- Because it allows slight movement it is classified functionally as an **amphiarthrosis**
	- The **interossous** membrane between the parallel borders of **radius** and **ulna** bone ( middle **radioulnar** joint)
	- between the parallel borders of the **tibia** and **fibula** ( **middle tibiofibular** joint). 
- **Gomphosis** : is a type of fibrous joint in which ==a cone-shape peg fits into a socket==. 
	- A gomphosis is classified functionally as a **synarthrosis**, an **immovable** joint.
	- The only example in the body is the **roots of teeth** and their **sockets** in the **maxilla** and the **mandible** bones.

### Cartilaginous joints
the bones are held together by cartilage and the is no synovial cavity
### Synovial joints  (Diarthrosis) 
the bones are held together by capsule and ligaments and there is a synovial cavity. [^1]

# functional classification 
degree of movement they permit
### Synarthrosis 
 An immovable joint
### Amphiarthrosis 
 A slightly movable joint
### Diarthrosis 
A freely movable joint , all **Diarthrosis** are **Synovial** joints


[^1]: A synovial joint is characterised by the presence of a fluid-filled joint cavity contained within a fibrous capsule.
