 the human skeleton the 206 bones and 32 teeth stand out.
# Cartilage
is more flexible than bone but stiffer than muscle.Cartilage helps give structure to the **larynx** and **nose**. It is also found between the **vertebrae** and at the **ends of bones** like the **femur**.
# ligaments 
- **Ligaments** are bands of **dense and fibrous** **connective** tissue 
-  are strong bands or straps of fibrous tissue that provide support to bones and *link bone ends together in and around joints.*  They are made of **collagen** - *a tough, elastic protein*. A large number of ligaments bind together the complex **wrist** and **ankle** joints .

# Anatomy of the Bone 
- **compact** : as a solid mass .
- **cancellous** : consists of a branching network of **trabeculae**,arranged in such a manner as to resist the stresses and strains to which the bone is exposed.

## Long bones 
 in the *humerus*,*femur*,*metacarpals*, *metatarsals*, and *phalanges* (fingers and toes) their length is greater than their breadth(width). 
 
**Long bone structures** 
- The **articular cartilage** is a thin layer of hyaline cartilage that covers each **epiphysis** where the wholebone forms an articulating joint with another bone. *reduces friction* and *absorbs shock* at freely movable joints.
- The **epiphyses** are the **proximal** and **distal** ends of the bone (the singular is **epiphysis**).
- The **metaphysis** are the regions in a **mature** bone where the diaphysis joins the epiphyses .
	- In a growing bone the **metaphysis** are regions that include the **epiphyseal plate** which is a plate of **hyaline cartilage** that allow the *growth* of the *diaphysis* in *length* . 
	- When the bone growth stops, the *cartilage* in the epiphyseal plate is replaced *bony* **epiphyseal line**.
- The **diaphysis** is the bone's shaft or body- the long,cylindrical,tubular , main portion of the bone.
- The **medullary cavity** or **marrow cavity** is the space within the diaphysis that contain the fatty yellow bone marrow in adults .

**covering layers** 

- The **Perio-steum** is a layer of connective tissue that covers the bone surface wherever there is no articular cartilage.
	- It help to grow in width,
	- protects the bone and nourishes it, 
	- helps in repair in fractures 
	- serves as an attachment point for ligaments and tendons.
	- Bundles of *collagen fibers* known as **Sharpey's fibers** extend from the **periosteum** into the underlying bone. It receives a rich nerve supply and is very sensitive
-  The **Endo-steum** is a thin membrane that lines the **medullary cavity**

## short bones 
In the foot ( **calcaneum**(s) , **talus**) and the hand (**scaphoid**  ,**lunate**)

-  roughly **cuboidal** in shape
- are composed of **cancellous** bone
- surrounded by a thin layer of **compact** bone 
- covered with **periosteum** 
- **articular** (joints) surfaces are covered by *hyaline cartilage*
## flat bones 
vault of the skull , frontal & parietal bones (**tables** of the skull )
![[Medical School/First year/anatomy/HSF/Resources/Pasted image 20231115231944.png|500]]
- thin inner and outer layer of compact  bones  
- seperated by **cancellous**  layer **[DiploÃ«](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplo%C3%AB)**
- The **scapulae** (shoulder) , although **irregular**, are included in this group.
## sesamoid bones
Sesamoid bones are small nodules of bone that are found in certain tendons where they rub over bony surfaces.
- The greater part of a sesamoid bone is buried in the tendon, and the free surface is covered with cartilage.
- The **largest** sesamoid bone is the **patella**,  in the tendon of the **quadriceps femoris** .(Knee)
- also in the tendons of the **flexor pollicis brevis** and **flexor hallucis brevis**.

- The function of a sesamoid bone 
	- reduce friction on the tendon 
	- alter the direction of pull of a tendon.
## irregular bones 
Irregular bones include those not assigned to the previous groups (e.g., the **bones of the skull**, the **vertebrae**, and the **pelvic** bones). 
They are composed of a **thin shell** of **compact** bone with an **interior** made up of **cancellous** bone.
