# planes 
1. sagittal planes ( vertical) 
	1. para-sagittal plane : away from the center or middle line  
	2. mid-sagittal plane : directly in the midline 
2. transverse (horizontal) plane : divides the body into **superior**  and **inferior** 
3. oblique planes : obliques are odd angles

| cephalic  | top of the head       |
| occipital | posterior head        |
| Deltoid   | curve of the shoulder |

# Angular movements 
-  **Flexion** and **extension** : in flexion there is decrease in angle between the articulating bones مفصل العظم while in extension there is an increase in the angle
- **Abduction** & ==A**d**duction== :  Abduction is the movement away from the midline whereas **add**uction is the movement toward the midline 
- **Circumduction** is the movement of the distal end of the body around a circle , continuous sequence of flexion, abduction,extension and adduction.
- **Rotation** means that the bone revolves around its own longitudinal axis
	- **medial** (internal) rotation : If the anterior surface of the limb is turned toward the midline
	- **lateral** (external ) rotation : f the anterior surface of the limb is turned away from the midline

## Special Movements at specific joints 
- **elevation**, **depression** : at the temporomandibular joint (closing and opening mouth) shoulders ( shrugging )
- **protraction** (forth), **retraction** : to draw froth or back as in protract the mandible or clavicles الترقوة  by crossing and extening ur arms 
- **inversion**  (inward), **eversion**(outward) :  soles medially **or** laterally  at the intertarsal joints (between the tarsals)
- **dorsiflexion**(dorsum الخلفي للقدم ), **planter flexion** bending of the foot :
	NOTE: dorsiflexion is true flexion, whereas planter flexion is true extension.
	
-  **supination**, **pronation** : proximal and distal radioulnar joints ![|400](Medical%20School/First%20year/anatomy/Resources/Pasted%20image%2020231114213602.png) 
> The Kings Pronate The beggers Supinate
- **opposition** :is the movement of the thumb at the carpometacarpal joint in which the thumb moves across the palm to touch the tips of the fingers on the same hand. This gives the ability to grasp and manipulate objects .
