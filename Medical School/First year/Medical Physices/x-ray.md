# X-ray tube 
 **x ray heart** 
  
The heart of an X-ray machine is an electrode pair -- a **cathode and an anode** -- that sits inside a **glass vacuum tube**.as the *electrical current flows* through the tube from cathode to anode, the **electrons** undergo an **energy loss**, which results in generation of x-rays .  

The anode is the component in which the x- radiation is produced.
- It is a relatively large piece of metal that connects to the positive side of the electrical circuit.
- The anode has two primary functions:
- to convert electronic energy into x- radiation, and 
- to dissipate the heat created in the process.
The material for the anode is selected to enhance these functions. The anode is usually composed of tungsten or molybdenum as it must withstand very high
temperatures (>3000 degrees oC) , corrrect warm up and stand precedures are essential to maximize tube and filament life time 
The anode is tilted at an angle of 12 to 17 degrees in order to maximise the contact area while focussing the resultant beam
